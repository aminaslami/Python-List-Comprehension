List comprehensions in Python provide a concise way to create lists. They are often used to apply some operation to each element of a sequence or to filter elements based on a condition. The basic syntax (Below):

    [expression for item in iterable if condition]

## Components:
**Expression:** Defines what to do with each element (e.g., modify or transform).

**For loop:** Iterates over the iterable.

**Condition (optional):** Filters elements based on a Boolean expression.
